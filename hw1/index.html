            <h2 class="section-title">Task 1: Rasterization of Triangles</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The task involves implementing basic triangle rasterization without supersampling. The goal is to
                rasterize
                triangles using the point-in-triangle test for each pixel, with a sample point located at the center of
                each
                pixel. The implementation should ensure that the triangle is drawn correctly regardless of its winding
                order
                and that no edges are left un-rasterized. The approach involves calculating the triangle's bounding box
                and
                iterating over each pixel within the bounding box to perform the point-in-triangle test. The details of
                the
                steps are: </p>
            <ul class="abcd-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Finding the Bounding Box:</strong> The first step is calculating the smallest rectangle
                    (bounding
                    box) that completely encloses the triangle. This is done by finding the minimum and maximum X and Y
                    coordinates among the triangle's three vertices. This step is crucial because it limits the area
                    needed
                    to check for filling in the triangle, making the process more efficient.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Iterating Over Each Pixel:</strong> Next, the code loops through each pixel within this
                    bounding box.
                    For each pixel, it determines if the pixel's center is inside the triangle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Point-in-Triangle Test:</strong> Barycentric coordinates must be applied to decide if a
                    pixel is part of
                    the triangle. By adding 0.5 to both the X and Y coordinates of the pixel, it can be ensured that the
                    test is
                    done at the center of the pixel, not the corner. This is a more accurate way to color the triangle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Coloring the Pixel:</strong> If the center of a pixel is found to be inside the triangle,
                    the pixel is colored
                    with the specified color.

            <!-- About Point-in-Triangle Test -->
            <p>
                In Lecture 2, we discussed how to test whether a point is inside a triangle. A common approach is the
                vector-based method.
                For me, the vector method is intuitive, essentially involving a simple check of the cross product values
                to see if they are on the same side. If a point is on the same side of all edges, then it's inside the
                triangle. A key aspect of this method is maintaining a consistent direction for the edges, typically
                clockwise or counterclockwise. If the edges of the triangle are arranged in a consistent direction (such
                as clockwise or counterclockwise), then this method is very effective. Based on this, I implemented this
                approach.
            <h3>Vector method</h3>
            <code>
bool RasterizerImp::isPointInTriangle(float x, float y, float x0, float y0, float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2) {<br>
    // Method 2: Vector cross product(edge function) method<br>
    // Convert triangle vertices and point into vectors<br>
    float v0x = x1 - x0;<br>
    float v0y = y1 - y0;<br>
    float v1x = x2 - x1;<br>
    float v1y = y2 - y1;<br>
    float v2x = x0 - x2;<br>
    float v2y = y0 - y2;<br><br>

    // Convert the test point into vectors relative to triangle vertices<br>
    float pv0x = x - x0;<br>
    float pv0y = y - y0;<br>
    float pv1x = x - x1;<br>
    float pv1y = y - y1;<br>
    float pv2x = x - x2;<br>
    float pv2y = y - y2;<br><br>

    // Compute the cross products<br>
    float cross0 = v0x * pv0y - v0y * pv0x;<br>
    float cross1 = v1x * pv1y - v1y * pv1x;<br>
    float cross2 = v2x * pv2y - v2y * pv2x;<br><br>

    // Check the sign of the cross products to determine if the point is on the same side of all edges<br>
    if ((cross0 >= 0 && cross1 >= 0 && cross2 >= 0) || (cross0 <= 0 && cross1 <= 0 && cross2 <= 0)) {<br>
        return true; // Point is inside the triangle<br>
    }<br>
    else {<br>
        return false; // Point is outside the triangle<br>
    }<br>
}
</code>
            Another method is the barycentric method, which we discussed in Lecture 5. This method can be efficiently
            constrained within the triangle's bounding box and can easily handle different winding orders.

            <h3>barycentric method</h3>
            <code>
    bool RasterizerImp::isPointInTriangle(float x, float y, float x0, float y0, float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2) {<br>
        // Method 1: Calculate vectors & dot products for barycentric coordinates<br>
        float denom = (y1 - y2) * (x0 - x2) + (x2 - x1) * (y0 - y2);<br>
        float a = ((y1 - y2) * (x - x2) + (x2 - x1) * (y - y2)) / denom;<br>
        float b = ((y2 - y0) * (x - x2) + (x0 - x2) * (y - y2)) / denom;<br>
        float c = 1 - a - b;<br><br>
    
        // Check if point is inside the triangle<br>
        return a >= 0 && a <= 1 && b >= 0 && b <= 1 && c >= 0 && c <= 1;<br>
    }
    </code>
            <p>I also encountered a small issue regarding the rounding, which was fixed by using floor and ceiling
                rounding methods</p>

                I am trying to improve function, and the first thing to do is precompute constants: Compute values that
                do
                not change within the loop before entering it. By simply moving 'float denom = (y1 - y2) * (x0 - x2) +
                (x2 -
                x1) * (y0 - y2);' out of my loop, I saved 300 microseconds(I called the timer functions in
                drawrend::redraw).
                I'm thinking about how to not check every sample in the bounding box, but honestly, I haven't figured it
                out
                yet. I don't know if it's possible to perform Coarse Clipping again before starting to iterate over the
                bounding box. I've seen suggestions to use hierarchical data structures such as Quadtree or Grid to
                organize
                space, which can quickly exclude areas not inside the triangle. Those methods seemed to be especially
                effective when dealing with a large number of triangles. However, I haven't implemented it yet.

            <h2 class="section-title">Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The main goal is to reduce the jagged edges (aliasing) that occur when rendering triangles.
                Supersampling achieves this by taking multiple samples within each pixel, determining how much
                of the pixel is covered by the triangle, and then averaging these samples to get the final color
                of the pixel. This approach simulates a higher-resolution rendering, which, when scaled down,
                produces smoother edges.
                Approach and Implementation:
                a. The process starts by calculating the number of samples to be taken within each pixel,
                determined by the square root of the sample_rate. The samples are spread across a grid within
                each pixel. For example, with a sample_rate of 4, a 2x2 grid is created inside each pixel.
                b. Rasterizing with Supersampling: The triangle is rasterized at a higher resolution equivalent
                to the number of samples. Each sample's color is determined based on whether it falls within the
                triangle using the point-in-triangle test.
                c. Resolving Supersamples to Framebuffer: After rasterizing at a higher resolution, the color of
                each pixel in the framebuffer is computed by averaging the colors of the corresponding samples.
                This effectively downsamples the higher-resolution image to the display resolution, resulting in
                smoother edges.
            </p>
            <h3>Breakdown of Modifications</h3>
            <p>
                a. Bounding Box Calculation:
                Identify the minimum and maximum X and Y coordinates among the vertices of the triangle to
                calculate the bounding box. This step is vital as it narrows down the sample area, making the
                process more efficient.


                b. Iterative Pixel Sampling: Loop through each pixel within the bounding box and subdivide it
                into the number of samples determined by the sample_rate. Calculate each sample's exact position
                within the pixel using the sampleStep.

                This nested loop iterates over every pixel within the bounding box and further divides each
                pixel according to the supersampling rate. It calculates the position of each sample within a
                pixel (sampleX, sampleY) by offsetting it based on the sampleStep and ensuring the sample point
                is centered within its portion of the pixel with +0.5f.

                c. Point-in-Triangle Test for Samples: For each sample, these checks if it lies within the
                triangle using the isPointInTriangle function. If so, the sample's color is set in
                sample_buffer. The sample_index calculation ensures that each sample within the supersampled
                grid is correctly mapped to its position in the buffer.

                d. Downsampling: Averaging Samples to Final Pixel Colors
                After rasterizing the scene at a higher resolution using supersampling, this code averages the
                colors of the supersamples for each pixel to compute the pixel's final color. It goes through
                the framebuffer pixel by pixel, collects the corresponding supersampled colors, averages them,
                and writes the result back to the framebuffer in a format suitable for display. This is the
                "downsampling" step, where the high-resolution supersampled image is reduced back to the
                framebuffer's resolution.

                This implementation of supersampling for antialiasing effectively smooths out jagged edges by
                averaging multiple samples within each pixel, simulating a higher-resolution rendering that,
                when scaled back, results in a visually smoother image.
                Once the code can be run, test4.svg can be rendered. The differences in the image quality are
                due to the varying levels of supersampling used in rendering the SVGs.

                Sample Rate 1: This is essentially no supersampling at all. Each pixel is sampled once, and its
                color is determined by whether the center of the pixel lies within the triangle. This results in
                sharper edges because there's no averaging of color. The pixel is either fully the triangle's
                color or not, creating a jagged appearance known as aliasing.
                Sample Rate 4: This involves supersampling with 4 samples per pixel, arranged in a 2x2 grid
                within each pixel. Each sample is tested to see if it lies within the triangle. The final color
                of the pixel is an average of these samples. This begins to smooth out the edges of the
                triangles, as the color of the pixels at the edge of the triangle is a mix of the triangle color
                and the background, depending on how many samples are inside the triangle.
                Sample Rate 16: With 16 samples per pixel arranged in a 4x4 grid, there's an even more
                significant averaging effect. The edges of the triangles become much smoother (or "blurrier") as
                more samples around the edge contribute to the average, creating a gradient effect from the
                color of the triangle to the background. This dramatically reduces the jagged edges and can make
                the image appear less sharp, as finer details may be lost in the averaging process.
                In summary, the increase in sample rate smooths out the edges by averaging more samples within
                each pixel, which blends the colors at the boundaries of the triangles. However, the trade-off
                is that higher sample rates can make the image look less appealing as the pixel colors become a
                mix of the triangle and background colors.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p><strong>Task 3</strong> requires me to implement the three transforms.</p>
            <img class="uniform-pictures" src="../images/Task3_code.png" alt="Task 3">
            <p>I started by using an affine
                transformation matrix, more specifically, a translation matrix:
                <code>Matrix3x3(1, 0, dx,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0, 1, dy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0, 0, 1);</code>

            <p>According to the class content: When this matrix is applied to a vector or a point in 2D space, it
                translates (moves) the point by <em>dx</em> units along the X-axis and <em>dy</em> units along the
                Y-axis.</p>

            <p>Then, I created a 3x3 matrix for scaling transformations in a 2D space:</p>
            <code>Matrix3x3(sx, 0, 0,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0, sy, 0,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0,  0, 1);</code>

            <p>When this scaling matrix is applied to a point or a vector in 2D space, it scales (enlarges or shrinks)
                the coordinates of that point. If <em>sx</em> and <em>sy</em> are greater than 1, the point will be
                scaled up (enlarged); if they are between 0 and 1, the point will be scaled down (shrunk).</p>

            <p>The third part I need to implement is the <code>rotate(float deg)</code> function, rotating an object
                around the origin in a 2D plane. As discussed in class, the equation I need to use is as follows:</p>
            <code>Matrix3x3(cos_theta, -sin_theta, 0,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sin_theta,  cos_theta, 0,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0,          0,         1);</code>

                    represent the arms. Each arm group contains two subgroups, one for the upper arm and one for
                    thelower arm.</p>
            <p>
                To adjust the lower arm so that it aligns correctly with the upper arm, I need to consider that
                the initial rotation point and the point where the lower arm should be connected have both moved due
                to the upper arm's rotation and translation</p>
            <img src="../images/Task3_robotHandsUp.png" alt="Task 3 robot hands up">
            <p>Let me explain how I did this. I set the upper arm's translate to （-90 -80）compared to the previous（90
                -40）, which now moves the element 40 units in the negative y-direction (visually upwards), making it
                higher. This is because when I initially rotated it 90 degrees, I noticed that the position of the upper
                arm was slightly low, so I moved it up by 40 units. In the transforms.cpp, my rotate function defines a
                2D rotation matrix that only takes an angle as a parameter, defaulting to rotate around the origin (0,
                0). This matrix does not directly specify a center of rotation; it's a transformation matrix that
                rotates around the coordinate origin. Through multiple trials and adjustments, I found that moving the
                lower arm 70 units up along the y-axis looked better, so I used translate(0, -70). Similarly, I modified
                the right arm, so the final effect is as follows. Specific data can be seen in my_robot.svg in my docs/
                directory.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Barycentric coordinates represent a system for expressing the location of a point within a triangle
                relative to its vertices. In this system, the position of any point can be described as a combination of
                weights assigned to each vertex of the triangle. These weights indicate how much influence each vertex
                has on the final position of the point, and they always add up to one to ensure the point remains within
                the confines of the triangle. Barycentric coordinates are particularly useful for interpolating values
                across the surface of a triangle. This is essential for tasks such as color blending, where the colors
                defined at the vertices of a triangle need to be smoothly transitioned across its interior.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/Task4_colorInterpolation.png" alt="Task 4 code">

            <p>
                To rasterize a triangle onto the screen, first, the triangle's vertices are given by (x0, y0), (x1, y1),
                and (x2, y2). Each vertex has an associated color c0, c1, and c2. The colors of the interior pixels are
                interpolated based on the vertices' colors using barycentric coordinates.
                I have already mentioned this method of Barycentric interpolation in task 1. Basically, it still
                involves first creating a bounding box and then calculating the three points alpha, beta, and gamma.
                my function rasterize_interpolated_color_triangle,I perform the >= 0 check, and by using gamma = 1.0f -
                alpha - beta, I have implicitly included the <= 1. Final step is <strong>Interpolate the color and fill
                    the pixel</strong>
                    Once we've confirmed the pixel is inside the triangle, we interpolate the color based on the
                    barycentric coordinates. The fill_pixel function colors the pixel at (x, y) with the interpolated
                    color. If you're using supersampling, ensure that fill_pixel properly combines the supersampled
                    colors.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Pixel sampling is like deciding how to mix your paint colors when you're zooming in on a tiny part of
                your painting. It wants the colors to blend nicely, so there are no harsh lines or blocky pixels. There
                are two types of pixel sampling:
            <ul class="abcd-list">
                <li>
                    Nearest Sampling (P_NEAREST): This is like using a big, broad brush to dab paint onto a canvas. It's
                    quick and straightforward, but the result can look a bit boxy because it is just picking the closest
                    color from a palette for each pixel without any blending.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bilinear Sampling (P_LINEAR):This is like using a finer brush and carefully blending the colors from
                    a
                    palette to get just the right shade for each tiny spot. Bilinear sampling blends the four closest
                    colors
                    (or texels, in texture terms) to smooth out the texture, making everything look more natural and
                    less
                    blocky.

            <h2 class="section-title">Task 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p> Level sampling is a technique used to handle how textures are displayed at different distances
                and angles relative to the viewer, which related to Mipmapping and texture filtering.Problem with Direct
                Texture Mapping: If I have a detailed texture (like a high-resolution image) applied to a surface
                in a 3D scene. When this surface is far away or viewed at a steep angle, the texture's details can't be
                correctly displayed on the screen due to limited screen resolution and pixel density. This mismatch
                often causes visual artifacts like moiré patterns and aliasing. That's why I should use Mipmapping,
                which involves creating multiple versions of the same texture at progressively lower resolutions.
                I want to explain some tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the various
                techniques that we used in this task:
            <ul class="abcd-list">
                <li>
                    Pixel Sampling: When I use pixel sampling, I'm essentially determining how many samples I'll take
                    within
                    each pixel to calculate its final color. Higher pixel sampling rates can significantly improve the
                    quality of antialiasing, making edges in my rendered images smoother and more natural-looking.
                    However,
                    the tradeoff is speed and performance. More samples per pixel mean more calculations, which slows
                    down
                    the rendering process. Additionally, higher sampling rates can increase memory usage, though this is
                    often less of a concern than the computational load.</li>
                <li>
                    Level Sampling: Level sampling, in my experience, is more about choosing the right level of texture
                    detail for different parts of an image. This method is particularly useful in reducing artifacts
                    like
                    moiré patterns in textures that are far away or seen at steep angles. The key tradeoff here is
                    between
                    memory usage and antialiasing power. Storing multiple levels of a texture (mipmaps) consumes more
                    memory, but it allows for better texture quality at various distances, which indirectly contributes
                    to
                    antialiasing. The impact on speed is generally positive since level sampling often avoids
                    overburdening
                    the renderer with unnecessarily high-resolution textures.</li>
                <li>
                    Number of Samples per Pixel: Adjusting the number of samples per pixel is a direct way to balance
                    quality and performance. When I increase the number of samples, I see a noticeable improvement in
                    antialiasing quality, as it reduces the aliasing artifacts. However, more samples per pixel directly
                    correlate to slower rendering times because the system needs to process more data for each pixel. In
                    terms of memory usage, the impact is relatively minor compared to the other two techniques, as it
                    doesn't necessarily require storing more texture data, just processing the existing data more
                    thoroughly.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In task 6, I first moved the part of my previous logic that checks if it's linear or nearest into the
                Texture::sample. Then, in the rasterize_textured_triangle, I make sure to scale up the difference
                vectors accordingly by the width and height of the full-resolution texture image.

                rate of change of the texture coordinates. This involves estimating the derivatives of the texture
                coordinates in screen space, which can be used to assess the degree of texture variation at a pixel,
                thereby
                selecting the appropriate Mipmap level. First, I calculate the derivatives of the texture coordinates in
                the
                x and y directions of screen space. Then, I calculate the magnitude of the gradients in these two
                directions
                and choose the larger of the two as my gradient. After that, I use the log2 function to calculate the
                Mipmap
                level. The log2 function used here is based on the magnitude of the gradient, which can represent the
                rate
                of texture change on the screen. Finally, I ensure that the returned level is not negative, as Mipmap
                levels
                cannot be negative.</p>

            <p>In the texture::sample, different levels can be selected: L_ZERO = 0, L_NEAREST = 1, L_LINEAR =
                2. And inside sp.lsm == L_LINEAR, I did a trilinear filtering. I interpolate between two adjacent Mipmap
                levels to obtain the final texture color. Here is the comparison of my final results:</p>
